# QDD_Net: Duplicate Question Detector 

## Introduction
This is the repository for [PPDAI](https://ai.ppdai.com/mirror/goToMirrorDetail?mirrorId=1&tabindex=2) contest, which is a natural language processing (NLP) model aims to detect duplicate questions in Chinese. 

## Data
Data was provided by PPDAI, which are pairs of questions labeled with 0 and 1 represents similar or not.
The questions are represented by two sequences of integers which are the indices of corresponding embedding vectors (word and character). 

## Model
We proposed three models including a RNN based model, CNN based model and a RCNN based model. These models have the following characteristics:  

1. Bi-Directional GRU in RNN based models for semantic learning.
2. 1-D Convolution in CNN and RCNN based models for local feature extraction.
3. Co-Attention was used to learn the semantic correlations between two sequences.
4. Self-Attention was used to enhance the feature representation.
5. Word embedding and Character Embedding were used simultaneously.

## Performance:
Our ensemble model achieved 0.203930 of loss in the semi-final, at the top 15% in ranking.
